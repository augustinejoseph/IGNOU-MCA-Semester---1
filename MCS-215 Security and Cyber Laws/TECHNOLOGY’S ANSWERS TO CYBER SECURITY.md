1. Unauthorised access - Strong passwords, endpoint security, two factor
authentications, physical security practices, monitoring user activity are few of the
common practices employed for protection against unauthorized access.
2. Distributed Denial of Service Attack – Various infocom security tools are used to
protect against DOS Attack like anti malware, firewall, spam filtering, switches and
routers, Intrusion prevention systems, DDOS defence systems, content delivery
network etc.(GOsafeonline,2014)
3. Malwares - a. Botnets - VPN, secured network architecture, traffic management tools
etc. can help in detecting and preventing botnet attack. b. Ransomwares - Backing up
data, disabling unnecessary ports or services such as RDP can help in preventing
ransomware attack c. Trojan - robust firewall, anti-spywares, maintaining cyber
hygiene are helpful against trojans d. Virus - Malware removal software, automatic
scans can reduce the risk of virus attacks, e. Worms - Internet connection firewall,
network intrusion detection software, use of Domain Message Authentication
Reporting (DMARC), Domain Name System Security Extension (DNSSEC) can be
helpful. f.
4. Spywares - Anti spywares, sandbox protection, ad pop up blockers can play
significant role in averting spywares.
5. Social Engineering attacks – network traffic analysis, firewalls, updated software,
spam protection guards, updated blacklists(Chizari, Hassan &Zulkurnain, et al
(2015) can aid in preventing social engineering attacks. However, it is considered that
the most efficient way to tackle social engineering attacks are awareness about such
attacks. Social engineering attacks thrive on people’s ignorance and hence awareness
is the key to fight against such attacks.
6. Phishing - SPAM filters, web filters, patching, use of SSL certificate to secure traffic
are a few technologies which may assist in combating Phishing attacks.

7. Cryptojacking- anti crypto mining extensions, endpoint protection, web filtering
tools, network monitoring solutions etc are helpful in preventing crypto
jacking.(Micheal Nadeau,2021),
8. Exploiting vulnerability – Patching operating systems, enabling SMB signing,
network segmentation which limits access to systems etc. may reduce the chances of
exploitation of vulnerability.
9. Cyber physical attacks- Adequate control on physical access, cyber nodes, enabling
remote access only when necessary, two factor authentications etc. are few of the
practices which have turned out beneficial in combating cyber physical attacks.
10. IOT attacks - Firmware updates with cryptographic signatures, proper identity
management, hardened toolchains, libraries and framework, etc may be used for
protection against IOT attacks.
11. Web Jacking - Web Server firewalls, X frames options etc may be used to prevent
web jacking.
12. Drive by download - Updating website components, web security software etc. can
provide protection against drive-by download.

    Cyber Security Intrusion Detection 



Intrusion detection systems monitor traffic and generate alerts in the case of suspicious
activity tending to harm the cyber security. However, some intrusion detection systems
are capable of even prevention of cyber threats. Such intrusion systems may be network,
host, hybrid, application, protocol based and method of detection may be signature based
or anomaly based. Signature based intrusion detection system detects intrusions based on
patterns or already known malicious instruction sequence. Anomaly based systems rely
on trustful activity model with the use of machine learning and anything dissimilar from
the model is alerted as suspicious. With the rise of IOT based environment use of such
intrusion detection systems have grown multi fold.

However, such detection systems are susceptible to few flaws like it has been witnessed that such
systems often raise false alarms, unable to avid encrypted packets, they need to be
continually updated and generally should be looked after by an expert engineer.

Strong Passwords, Firewalls, Encryption, Digital Signature, Clipper Chip,
Routers/Gateways, Free software programs like security administrator tool, COPS, Omni
Guard and Net probe which can identify any obstacle in the security mechanism and can
be adopted to be safe at all times.
