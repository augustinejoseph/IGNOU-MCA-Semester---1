1. Unauthorised access– It is accessing computer, computer, network, system or device
without permission from those who are authorized to access the same.
Eg. Mr. Shyam spies on Ms. Rita and gets to know unlocking pattern set on her
mobile device. Then Mr. Shyam without permission of Ms. Rita access pictures stored
in her mobile device. This is an unauthorized access. Another example would be Mr.
Shyam knows email address of Ms. Rita but not password. He tries different
permutation and combination of passwords and finally gets access to all the emails 
received by Ms. Rita. Unauthorized can be in the physical form too. Let’s say Ms.
Rita without permission from Ms. Shyam steals his pen drive and then accesses data
stored in it. This acts also amounts to unauthorized access. Similarly stealing
credit/debit card and then trying to use it for siphoning someone else’s money
involves element of unauthorized access.


2. Distributed Denial of Service Attack - It is aimed to adversely affect functioning of
a website by sending multiple requests to a website which is beyond its control to
handle. It's an attack on a machine or network resource to make it unavailable to
intended users by flooding it with unnecessary traffic.(GOsafeonline (2014). Mr. AB
creates a botnet herd which upon the command from control and command server
sends huge amount of data to a server hosting a banks website resulting slowing down
of the website. This is an example of denial-of-service attack on the bank.
3. Malwares - Malwares are software which are designed to harm network or device. It
includes Botnets, Ransomwares, Trojan, Virus, Worms, Spywares etc. Botnets are
collections of devices connected through the internet and infected with malware so the
same may be controlled to carry out cyber-attacks. Ransomwares are malwares which
encrypts files, data etc of the victim and then demands ransom from the victim to
decrypt or permit access to files or data. Trojan is a malicious software which prima
facie looks legitimate but is intended to steal, harm, damage device of victim. Term
trojan has been picked from an ancient Greek story where a large structure resembling
a horse was used to lead an attack against the city of Troy. Virus is a malicious
programme which is designed to affect the functioning of a computer/device in which
it is executed and capable of spreading from one computer to another. Virus is a
malicious programme capable of self-replicating and spreading across networks.
Spywares are malicious software which are installed in victims’ devices without his
knowledge to secretly spy and gather information of victims.
Eg. One of the most infamous malware till date is ILOVEYOU malware spread in the
year 2000. The mail prompted the victim to download ‘LOVE-LETTER-FORYOU.TXT.vbs’ attachment. The malware was in fact a worm and it overwrote system
file and personal files of those who ended up downloading them.
4. Social Engineering attacks - These attacks harp upon psychological manipulation of
victims and tricking the victim into revealing sensitive information. The victim is
tricked to click on a malicious link or respond to fraudulent mail etc.
5. Phishing - It’s an activity by which the victim is deceived to reveal sensitive
information like username, passwords, credit/debit card details etc by disguising
oneself as a trustworthy entity. Coining of term ‘phishing’ is inspired from term
fishing as in fishing, bait is cast to fool fishes similarly deceiving
message/mail/webpage is cast to fool innocent online user. Eg. Employee Ms. CD
apparently receives a mail from Finance Officer of the Company in which she is
working. The mail is in fact sent by an imposter who has disguised himself/herself as
Finance officer.
6. Crypto jacking - It is unauthorised use of victims' device to secretly mine crypto
currency. Crypto currency is a virtual currency with no central regulatory or issuing
authority and secured through crypto currency. Crypto jacking affects the functioning 
5
of devices as the same takes a toll on the device. For e.g Malwares use CPU’s for
mining crypto currency.
7. Exploiting vulnerability- Vulnerability is a flaw in the measures taken to secure a
device. Such flaw is exploited by the attacker to gain access over the device or harm
it.
8. Cyber physical attacks - These are cyber-attacks breaching the security and
impacting the physical environment. This may include shutting down of cameras,
lights etc. which are cyber controlled.
E.g. Cyber attacker takes control over water pumps controlled by technology and
causes destruction to property. Attacker taking control over cooling systems in
nuclear reactor has the potential to inflict tremendous harm and pose threat to national
security and safety.
9. Internet of Things (IOT) attacks - Embedded devices that are connected to a
network and capable of transferring data are at the risk of being attacked through
exploiting vulnerability and can be hacked.
For e.g., Fax machines connected to internet may be exploited with their vulnerability
and data can be stolen.
10. Web Jacking - Web jacking a term inspired from hijacking, means hijacking a
website or its access and control is taken over by the attacker. This taking over is then
misused for tricking the visitors of a website or deface the website.
11. Drive by download - A legitimate website is compromised and when the victim
browses such a compromised website, the same installs malicious payload in the
victim’s device. This malicious payload can be in the form of ransomware.
Some of the common security issues witnessed in cyberspace in recent past are as
follows: (Dr S.R. Myneni, p472-473).
    1. Internet time theft: This involves usage by unapproved persons of the internet
    hours paid for by another person.
    2. Key Loggers: It is a software database or a program intended to covertly keep an
    eye on and log all keystrokes. The Key logger software scans computers, their
    processes, and data, the moment a person hits a key on the keyboard. This
    information is straightaway transmitted over to an external control.
    3. Website defacement: This is usually transmitted by the replacement of the
    homepage of a site by a system cracker that dislocated into a web server and
    modifies the hosted website creating one of its own. The attacker usually replaces
    the site matters with his own message or completely destroys the site’s contents.
    4. Pharming: This takes place when the attacker redirects a user from an authentic
    and genuine site to a fake and deceitful site where their systems are infused with
    malware. 
    6
    5. Phreaking: This refers to people who interfere with systems of
    telecommunication such as public networks.
    6. Email bombing: This refers to forwarding a significant large number of emails to
    the victim resulting in the victim’s email account or mail servers to not respond.
